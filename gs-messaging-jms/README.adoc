This guide walks you through the process of publishing and subscribing to messages using a JMS broker.

== What you'll build

You'll build an application that uses Spring's `JmsTemplate` to post a single message and subscribes to it with a POJO using `MessageListenerAdapter`.

== Create a message receiver
Spring provides the means to publish messages to any POJO.

`src/main/java/hello/Receiver.java`
[source,java]

This is also known as a **message driven POJO**. As you can see in the code above, there is no need to implement any particular interface or for the method to have any particular name.

== Send and receive JMS messages with Spring
Next, wire up a sender and a receiver.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]

To wrap the `Receiver` you coded earlier, use `MessageListenerAdapter`. Then use the `setDefaultListenerMethod` to configure which method to invoke when a message comes in. Thus you avoid implementing any JMS or broker-specific interfaces.

The `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` class is an asynchronous message receiver. It uses the `MessageListenerAdapter` and the `ConnectionFactory` and is fired up when the application context starts. Another parameter is the queue name set in `mailboxDestination`. It is also set up to receive messages in a publish/subscribe fashion.

Spring provides a convenient template class called `JmsTemplate`. `JmsTemplate` makes it very simple to send messages to a JMS message queue. In the `main` runner method, after starting things up, you create a `MessageCreator` and use it from `jmsTemplate` to send a message.

Two beans that you don't see defined are `JmsTemplate` and `ActiveMQConnectionFactory`. These are created automatically by Spring Boot. In this case, the ActiveMQ broker runs embedded.

NOTE: Spring's `JmsTemplate` can receive messages directly through its `receive` method, but that only works synchronously, meaning it will block. That's why Spring recommends that you use the `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` with a cache-based connection factory, so you can consume messages asynchronously and with maximum connection efficiency.

When it runs, buried amidst all the logging, you should see these messages:

....
Sending a new mesage.
Received <ping!>
....

== Summary
Congratulations! You've just developed a publisher and consumer of JMS-based messages.
